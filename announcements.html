    <h2> “We have to make sure that we ALL move FORWARD.” - Atty. Mauricio G. Domogan
        Guisad Valley National High School celebrated its 11th Legislation Anniversary starting off with a Thanksgiving Mass led by Father Claudio A. Banasan, the Parish Priest at St. Vincent de Ferrer Parish followed by a simple program highlighting the achievements of the school over the past years as an annex of BCNHS and PCNHS and as a legislated school for 11 years.
        Gracing the event as the speaker is Atty. Mauricio G. Domogan, the author of the HB that led to the legislation of GVNHS as independent school from PCNHS. 
        Speaking on the theme, “GVNHS@11: Bridging the Educational Gaps Amidst the Pandemic,” Atty. Domogan highlighted on the importance of teachers making sure that learning is effective even during this difficult times. 
        “No one can dispute￼ that education is the best Legacy that we can pass to our children. It is one that cannot be stolen. It can be brought in any place where you go. That simplifies how important education is,” he emphasized. ￼
        Clean and Green activities were conducted in the afternoon still as part of the school’s program of activities for this year’s celebration.</h2>
